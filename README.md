## Tools used:

    - PYTHON FLASK
    - Ultralytics YOLOV8 Algorithm (Detection)
    - HTML & CSS
    - ROBOFLOW DATASETS 

## Goals
    - Gather Handwritten dataset to be used in training
    - Train a machine learning model to recognize characters
    - Create a Web implementation of the project
    - Be able to use the model to recognize images
    - Predict the images correctly with above 70% Accuracy

## Challenges
    - Datasets used annotation and labeling
    - Low accuracy prediction
    - Implementation of YoloV8 Model

## Dataset
All dataset used for training can be found in the link below:

## Algorithm
The training model used is a Convolutional neural network(CNN) called You only look once (YOLOv8) from Ultralytics. It is a computer vision algorithm used for detecting patterns and objects on images.

1. Gather Dataset, Annotate and Label the characters.
2. Divide the dataset for Training, Validation and Testing
3. Load the dataset on Google colab or Jupyter notebook
4. Train the model
5. Validate the model
6. Test the model
